# Prototype of PyCat 
This prototype only uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript (vanilla javascript and d3.js library). The "psi" angle is not yet working as of 3/20/23, however all other aspects of the UI function.

TO DO:
- get psi (cone angle) working
- put real images behind leminscate
- create function that calculates lat/lon and aWidth based on scale of actual image pixels
